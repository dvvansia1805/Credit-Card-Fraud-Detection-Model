 <h1>Credit Card Fraud Detection Model</h1>
 <p>This project aims to develop a robust and efficient machine-learning model that detects fraudulent credit card transactions in real-time. With the increasing prevalence of online transactions and the ever-evolving sophistication of fraudsters, it has become crucial to implement advanced fraud detection techniques to protect financial institutions and customers from significant monetary losses.</p>
 <h2>Workflow</h2>
 <ul>
   <li>Credit Card Data</li>
   <li>Data Preprocessing</li>
   <li>Data Analysis</li>
   <li>Train Test Split</li>
   <li>Logistic Regression Model</li>
   <li>Evaluation</li>
 </ul>
 <h2>Logistic Regression</h2>
 <p>In this model, we will give a labeled data set. It consists of several thousands of datasets of credit cards.</p>
 <p>Labels are:</p>
 <ul>
   <li>Credit Card Fraud</li>
   <li>No Credit Card Fraud</li>
 </ul>
 <p>In this, we will use a Logistic Regression Model. Logistic Regression Model is <strong>a data analysis technique that uses mathematics to find the relationships between two data factors</strong>. It then uses this relationship to predict the value of one of those factors based on the other. The prediction usually has a finite number of outcomes, like yes or no.</p>
 <p>It is a binary classification problem.</p>
 <h2>Dataset</h2>
 <p>The dataset used for this project is available on Kaggle: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud" target="_blank">https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud</a></p>
